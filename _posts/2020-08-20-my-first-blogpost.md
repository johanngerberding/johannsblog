Hi everyone, 

my name is Johann and I am a research scientist from Germany. Recently I stumbled upon the blog of [Lilian Weng from OpenAI](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/), which you definitively should check out if you are interested in Machine Learning especially in Reinforcement Learning (her posts are very detailled and well written). Her blog is basically a collection of her notes while learning new things and I loved this idea. So I decided to build my own one where I will document my notes on the topics I study. 

Best regards and stay healthy, 

Johann
