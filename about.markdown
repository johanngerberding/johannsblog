Hello everybody, my name is Johann, I am an industrial engineer and research scientist from Germany interested in the broad field of Machine Learning. My research focuses mainly on the transfer of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms into business applications. Currently I am predominantly working in the field of Computer Vision but I look forward to diving deeper into Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning in the future.

I am a kind of self-taught developer who considers himself still pretty much at the beginning. However, I still have a lot to learn but really enjoy the process of researching new things and am currently studying the basics of Natural Language Processing on coursera. 

I use my blog as a kind of learning diary in which I occasionally write short blog posts on topics related to machine learning or algorithms in which I am interested or currently working on.

In my spare time I enjoy reading a book or doing sports, especially soccer and calisthenics. If you want to know more about me, get in touch with me, have questions or find any errors here, feel free to have a look at my contact information down below or simply send me an E-Mail (johann.gerberding@gmail.com).
