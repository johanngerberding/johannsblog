Hello everybody, my name is Johann, I am a research scientist from Germany interested in the broad field of Machine Learning. My "research" (some people could argue that the stuff we are doing is no real research, sometimes I feel the same ;)) focuses mainly on the transfer of machine learning algorithms into business applications (prototypes, not the real stuff). Currently I am predominantly working in the field of Computer Vision but I look forward to diving deeper into Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning in the future (robotics could also be a lot of fun and a ton to learn).

I am a kind of self-taught developer who considers himself still pretty much at the beginning (noob). However, I still have a lot to learn but really enjoy the process of researching new things and am currently trying to learn C++. I am somewhat proficient in writing Python code but I would like to know a real programming language too ;)  

I use my blog as a kind of learning diary in which I occasionally write short blog posts on topics related to machine learning, algorithms or other cool stuff in which I am interested or currently working on.

In my spare time I enjoy reading a book or doing sports, especially soccer and calisthenics. If you want to know more about me, get in touch with me, have questions or find any errors here, feel free to have a look at my contact information down below or simply send me an [E-Mail](<johann.gerberding@gmail.com>).
